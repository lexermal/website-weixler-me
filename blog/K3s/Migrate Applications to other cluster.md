1. Upgrade the application to the newest version
2. Scale the application down to 0
3. Attach PVCs to the server via Longhorn UI
4. Create a folder in tmp for mounting, it should be explainable like the application name and PVC size e.g. mount-gitlab-30gb
5. Mount all PVCs with ```mount /dev/longhorn/pvc-name /tmp/mount-gitlab-30gb/```
6. Go in the directory with ```cd mount-gitlab-30gb```
7. Compress ```tar czvf ../${PWD##*/}.tar.gz .```
